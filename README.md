# PyBrotherInfo
A CLI made in python to retrieve information from the Brother Printer and send it by e-mail to the Administrators of the Printer.

## Getting Started
This 'module' or 'script' (or something like that, I have not set it yet) has been tested with the Brother DCP-L5652DN.

### Prerequisites
You will need these tools to run.

- Python3
- Virtualenv
- Git

### Installing
To install PyBrotherInfo, make the project clone with the command below.

```bash
    git clone https://github.com/zerossB/PyBrotherInfo.git
```

Then install the project dependencies using pip

```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then run the project.

If you want you can even put a routine on your operating system to pick up this information within a time span.
